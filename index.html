				<h4><b>CHENNAI METRO COMPLETES TRACK-LAYING PHASE I EXTENSION PROJECT</b></h4>
				<img style="width: 50%" src="images/metro.jpg">
				<p><b>With June the deadline for beginning services, Chennai Metro Rail has now finished laying tracks in the phase I extension project that links Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar, covering a distance of 9 km.According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the work that began more than a year ago was completed only a few weeks ago. “We are particular about opening this stretch to the public in June; so, we are trying to finish one job after another so that we can meet the deadline. There were a lot of challenges working in this 9 km-stretch but we have been able to manage everything so far. Now that the track work is over, the trial run with a locomotive can be done,” an official said.The trial is likely to happen this month with the locomotive and soon after that, the train will be run through to check for any possible glitches that arise. “These trial runs will go on till the operations start in June and we will conduct various tests to see that there is no problem before passengers travel through this stretch,” another official said.</b></p><br><hr>
			

				<h4><b>2020: The Year of Mobile Sneak Attacks?</b></h4>
				<img src="images/sn.jpg">
				<p><b>McAfee released its Mobile Threat Report 2020, which found that hackers are using hidden mobile apps, third-party login and counterfeit gaming videos to target consumers.Last year, hackers targeted consumers with a wide variety of methods, from backdoors to mining cryptocurrencies, says the company. Based on new research, McAfee has uncovered that hackers have expanded the ways of hiding their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and remove, which makes it seem like 2020 will be the year of mobile sneak attacks.McAfee found that hidden apps are the most active mobile threat facing consumers, generating nearly 50 percent of all malicious activities in 2019— a 30 percent increase from 2018. Hackers continue to target consumers through channels that they spend the most time on— their devices, as the average person globally is expected to own 15 connected devices by 2030. Hidden apps take advantage of unsuspecting consumers in multiple ways, including taking advantage of consumers using third-party login services or serving unwanted ads.“Consumers are connected more than ever, and as we look at the current security landscape, as well as future risks, we want to make sure we are doing everything to help consumers protect what matters more to them— their personal data, as well as their family and friends,” said Terry Hicks, Executive Vice President, Consumer Business Group at McAfee. “Mobile threats are playing a game of hide and steal, and we will continue to empower consumers to safeguard their most valued assets and data.”</p></b><br><hr>

				<h4>Corona virus spreads very fast</h4>
				<img style="si" src="images/cor.jpg">
				<p>In the paper in press with the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, a team of scientists from the United States, France, China and Hong Kong were able to calculate what's called the serial interval of the virus. To measure serial interval, scientists look at the time it takes for symptoms to appear in two people with the virus: the person who infects another, and the infected second person.Researchers found that the average serial interval for the novel coronavirus in China was approximately four days. This also is among the first studies to estimate the rate of asymptomatic transmission.The speed of an epidemic depends on two things -- how many people each case infects and how long it takes for infection between people to spread. The first quantity is called the reproduction number; the second is the serial interval. The short serial interval of COVID-19 means emerging outbreaks will grow quickly and could be difficult to stop, the researchers said."Ebola, with a serial interval of several weeks, is much easier to contain than influenza, with a serial interval of only a few days.</p><br><br><hr>
